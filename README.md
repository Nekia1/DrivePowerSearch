# Drive Search

| | |
|---|---|
| **Version** | 0.1.0 |
| **Created** | 2026-11-10 |
| **Spec** | [`docs/SPEC.md`](docs/SPEC.md) v1.3.1 (original idea: [`docs/rough_prompt.md`](docs/rough_prompt.md)) |

A command-line tool that searches your Google Drive by file name and creation date. It prints a report in the terminal and saves the same report as Markdown and HTML in `search_results/`. In the HTML report, each file path is a link that opens the file in Drive.

It asks only for **read-only access to file details** (names, dates, folders). It can't open, change or delete your files.

## 1. One-time setup

***You MUST to replace {user_account} with your own Windows local user account folder name for these commands below to work correctly.***

### 1.1 Conda environment
In **Anaconda Prompt**:
```
cd "C:\Users\{user_account}\Documents\00_PythonWIP\DrivePowerSearch"
conda env create -f setup\environment.yml      # skip if "powertools" already exists
conda activate powertools
```

### 1.2 Google Cloud setup (creates `credentials.json`)
You only do this once. It takes about 15 minutes in a browser, and it's free.

**Follow the step-by-step guide: [docs/google_cloud_setup.md](docs/google_cloud_setup.md).** It covers every screen, a checklist to confirm it worked, troubleshooting for common errors, and security tips.

In short: create a Google Cloud project, turn on the Google Drive API, set up the OAuth consent screen (External, Testing) and add yourself as a test user, then create a **Desktop app** OAuth client. Download its JSON as **`credentials.json`** into this folder:
`C:\Users\{user_account}\Documents\00_PythonWIP\DrivePowerSearch\credentials.json`

`credentials.json` and `token.json` are listed in `.gitignore`. **Never commit or share them.**

### 1.3 First sign-in
The first search opens your browser:
- Choose your account.
- Google will say **"Google hasn't verified this app"**. That's expected for a personal app in testing mode. Click **Continue**.
- Allow read-only access.

The tool saves the sign-in as `token.json`, so later runs don't open the browser.

> **Testing-mode note:** while the app's publishing status is "Testing", Google expires the saved sign-in after **7 days**. When that happens, the tool simply opens the browser again. You can avoid this by publishing the app, but the permission the tool uses is one Google classes as "restricted", so read the guide's "Testing vs In production" section first.

## 2. Usage
```
conda activate powertools
cd "C:\Users\{user_account}\Documents\00_PythonWIP\DrivePowerSearch"
python -m drive_search --name budget
```

**Examples**
```
# Names containing "budget", created in 2026
python -m drive_search --name budget --created-after 2026-01-01 --created-before 2026-12-31

# Exact name, created on one day
python -m drive_search --name "Q3 Report.docx" --exact --created-on 2026-10-02

# Include shared drives and show progress messages
python -m drive_search --name invoice --include-shared-drives --verbose
```

**Options**
| Option | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--name TEXT` | **Required.** Text to match in file names |
| `--exact` | Match the whole name exactly (case-sensitive). Default: name contains TEXT (case-insensitive) |
| `--created-on YYYY-MM-DD` | Only files created on this local date |
| `--created-after` / `--created-before YYYY-MM-DD` | Inclusive date range. Can't be combined with `--created-on` |
| `--include-shared-drives` | Also search shared drives |
| `--output-dir PATH` | Report folder. Default: `./search_results` (relative to where you run the command) |
| `--log-level LEVEL` | `DEBUG`, `INFO` (default), `WARNING` or `ERROR` |
| `--log-dir PATH` | Log folder. Default: `logs/` in this project folder |
| `--verbose` | Show progress (INFO) messages in the terminal |
| `--version` / `--help` | |

**Exit codes:** 0 success · 1 unexpected error · 2 invalid arguments · 3 sign-in problem · 4 Google Drive error · 5 reports couldn't be saved · 130 cancelled (Ctrl+C)

## 3. Output
- **Terminal:** the report tables.
- **`search_results/drive_search_<YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS>.md` and `.html`:** a new pair on every run, so earlier reports are never overwritten.
- Each report contains the search terms (including defaults), the run date and time with your UTC offset, the number of files found, and a table with file name, created, modified and full path.

**About "full path":** Google Drive has no real paths, so the tool rebuilds one from each file's folders, for example `My Drive/Projects/2026/report.pdf`. Files shared with you, whose folders you can't see, show as `(shared with me)/...`. A file with several parent folders shows the first one.

## 4. Logs
`logs/drive_search.log` (created automatically on first run). It records each run's start and end, sign-in steps, each page of results, and the reports written. Every line in a run shares the same `run=xxxxxxxx` ID.
- At the default `INFO` level, the log records **counts, not file names**. Use `--log-level DEBUG` to include names.
- Tokens and secrets are never logged.
- If `logs/` can't be written to, logs go to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\DriveSearch\logs`. If that fails too, they go to the terminal only.

## 5. Tests
```
conda activate powertools
python -m pytest
```
The tests use a fake Drive and make no network calls.

## 6. Known limitations
- **"Contains" means word-prefix matching.** Google's `name contains` matches the start of words: `--name budg` finds "Budget 2026.xlsx", but `--name get` does not. Searching for a whole word works as you'd expect.
- Dates use your computer's time zone.
